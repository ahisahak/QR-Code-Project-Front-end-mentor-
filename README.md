## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Working on this project, I learned that sometimes, you just have to approach problems with a basic understanding and not overthink things. I also learned that CSS custom properties can be very useful for styling components.

### Continued development

I want to focus more on building responsive designs and improving my web dev skills in general. I'm also working on becoming a professional full-stack developer/software engineer.
